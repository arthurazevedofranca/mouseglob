1. Create Experiment...
    1. Name Experiment
    2. Choose video file
    3. Calibrate
    4. Setup Maze
    5. Setup Tracking
    6. Add Trackers
    7. Choose Analyses
2. Run Experiment
3. Collect Reports

FIXED	polygon zone and boundary not mutex -> NullPointerException
FIXED	key event: key not showing in inspector
FIXED	movie jump not working (springs back to current position)
FIXED	fix coords file path
FIXED	scale format in coords file is not localized
DONE	keep last browsed directory
DONE	export boundaries and zones in column pairs (xy,xy,xy...)
DONE	apply boundaries mask directly inside trackers instead of whole image
DONE	associate trackers to boundaries
DONE	add EmptyBorder to tree nodes to provide padding between rows
FIXED	scale was not loaded from file
DONE	light zones up when trackers visit
DONE	inspector panel is correctly cleared when the selected inspectable is removed or a non-inspectable object is selected
DONE	jump movie when loading experiment
DONE	export movie boundaries to ^ file
DONE	display plot axis labels
DONE	suppress Image.copy() calls in TrackingManager.process() -> add buffer parameter to image operations
DONE	manage redrawing of PlotApplets -> now asynchronous
PARTIAL	(log key events in live video stream into a .SRT file): try to order events by start time
DONE	dynamically load external modules
DONE	PositionAnalysis is not absolute
DONE	export PlotReport to images (PNG, JPG)
FIXED	Angle plot not updating
DONE	create experiment summary plots
FIXED	VisitEventListener report not updating
DONE	export report data to clipboard
DONE	move all tracking series into Trajectory (rename?) -> became Dataset
FIXED	movie broadcasts first frame before jumping to load position (toggle analyses update with Record button)
DONE	include calibration information when calculating/displaying analyses
DONE	draw ColorBar outside of HeatMap
DONE	sort Analyses alphabetically on selection dialog
DONE	display statistics
DONE	copy smoothed curve to clipboard
FIXED	correct MouseModel for calibration
FIXED	investigate synchronization bug: NPE in Series1D.get(int) when using SmoothedSeries
FIXED	when smoothed, series doesn't update in plot
FIXED	Summary report not updating in real-time
DONE	save and load selected Analyses to/from Experiment file
DONE	parallelize Optimizer and ScalarMap Operations
DONE	parallelize image processing with ForkJoin
DONE	Tracker head painted in wrong position when Tracker is out of the top and left borders
FIXED	when selecting Tracking on the tree, resets tracking background
DONE	put Probe in a status bar instead of hovering over the Plot
DONE	implement primitive double List without autoboxing/unboxing
DONE	correct Axis width measurement (implement Tick?)
DONE	obtain background image when loading difference mode experiment
DONE	SpontaneousAlternationReport
DONE	complete alternation report
DONE	parallelize BinaryImage operations (dilate/erode)
DONE	implemented DoubleMatrixPool to recycle 'double[][]'s and reduce memory usage in Scalar/Vector/TensorMaps
DONE	implemented IntegerArrayPool to recycle 'int[]'s and reduce memory usage in Images
DONE	set Visit duration threshold, to join close events or discard short ones
FIXED	fix FilteredTimedEvent Statistics updating when event resumed
DONE	implement Time search
DONE	update VisitEvent masks inside VisitAnalysis.update() to avoid recalculating
DONE	calculate distance statistics inside of zone
DONE	add option to adjust HeatMap scale (log-scale)

implement area analyses (area inside zone, freezing)
PropertyInspectors don't update and disappear after reselecting the Inspector
open WMV files!
add headers to text reports with movie file name (+ tracker name)
export Analysis results to file
distinguish mouse head and tail
pause at the end of the movie
shape drawing not to scale (if Applet painting scale not 1:1)
re-enable fast-forwarding
localize values copied to clipboard
CSV files were not correctly opened in Excel in pt_BR locale

future:
bypass processing.Movie library and manipulate GStreamer directly
nudge shapes (move them altogether, mouse/kb)
position and angle histograms
implement Java2D plot rendering
